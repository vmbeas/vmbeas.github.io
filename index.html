                    <div class="col-sm-6"><h3>What is <span class="strongbuilt">StrongBuilt</span>?</h3>
                    <span class="strongbuilt">StrongBuilt</span> is a patented, high-performance concrete building system. We start with a specially designed insulating foam panel. The foam panel is reinforced with stainless steel welded wire mesh on both sides of it. The layers of mesh connect to each other through the foam panel with welded wire. Then we cast our special, high performance, concrete mix on both sides of the foam panel. This creates an airtight, and high strength system that is used to monolithically cast the walls and ceilings of a structure. The roofs can also be made using the system.

                    <div class="col-sm-6"><h3><span class="efficient">Energy Efficiency</span></h3>
                        <p>The <span class="strongbuilt">StrongBuilt</span> System is very energy efficient. The system can be designed to have R-Values ranging from R14 to R38. By having a layer of our high-performance concrete on the interior, conditioned side of the structure, our system has a very low U-factor. This means that once a room is at the desired temperature, it will stay there for a longer period of time. The result is that your strong built structure will require less energy to heat and cool; saving you money.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="subtext">U-factors generally range from 0.2 (very little heat loss) to 1.2 (high heat loss). The U-factor is the inverse of the R-value, which measures insulating value.</li>

                <h3>The <span class="strongbuilt">StrongBuilt</span> story</h3>
                <p>Company founder, Jeff Manning, was trying to solve the housing shortages in the oil patch. He visited many areas in Western Texas to assess the need first hand. The lack of available workforce in these areas prompted him to consider building livable structures off site; where labor was available. These structures needed to be both durable and energy efficient; to withstand the harsh environments where a lot of the oil patches are located. Traditional manufactured housing could not stand up to the forces mother nature exerted in the desert environments of West Texas. Jeff knew that he could come up with a sustainable, housing solution. </p>
                <p>Jeff relied upon his many years’ experience in the construction industry. He knew concrete is extremely durable, and structures built out of concrete lasted hundreds, even thousands of years. It also holds temperatures well. He thought precast concrete modules, the size of standard hotel rooms, may be the solution. The modules would be cast in areas where labor was readily available and more affordable. These modules would have to be able to withstand the abuse of being shipped hundreds of miles, the wear and tear of the men who would live in them, and the abuse that mother nature regularly exerted; high winds, extreme temperatures and tornados. </p>
                <p>After calculating the weight of precast concrete units, Jeff quickly realized why the concept hadn’t already been used. Using the conventional technology of the time, the concrete modules would be far too heavy to ship. His idea to precast concrete rooms would have to be completely rethought, and new technologies found; to make a precast structure of this size, viable. He worked with structural engineers, and experts in the concrete industry, to come up with a solution to make precast concrete modules that would be extremely durable, energy efficient and light enough to ship across country. The end result is a truly revolutionary construction system. The <span class="strongbuilt">StrongBuilt</span> system exceeds all of the needed attributes to make Jeff’s goal, a reality.</p>
                <p>Once the engineering was completed and the system proven buildable, Jeff quickly realized that the strengths designed into the system, that allowed the concrete modules to be shipped across country, also made them extremely resilient to the forces of mother nature and man-caused catastrophes. The system’s performance exceeded Jeff’s initial goals and can be used to construct any structure that needs to protect people or other high valued assets. The uses range from saferooms to multi-storied military barracks. Now houses are being designed utilizing the <span class="strongbuilt">StrongBuilt</span> system. They will provide their owners with the peace of mind that they are safe in their home, and saving money every month with lower energy costs.</p>
                <p>Jeff’s vision is that anyone desiring an energy efficient, safe place to live, work or play, will choose the <span class="strongbuilt>">StrongBuilt</span> system for their next project.</p>
